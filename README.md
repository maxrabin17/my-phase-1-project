## Javascript Weather App
This is a pure Javascript weather app, fetching data from the WeatherAPI courtesy of RapidAPI (Just try not to make 10,000 requests!).

## How to use
- Head to [this link](https://maxrabin17.github.io/my-phase-1-project/).
- Enter in your Zipcode (not every Zipcode is in the database, if yours does not work try the nearest big city *which you can search by name*!)
- Click on the temperature to change from Fahrenheit to Celcius.
- Click on the wind speed to change from Miles per hour (mp/h) to Kilometers per hour (kp/h).

## Final
Thank you for using my Javascript Weather App!
